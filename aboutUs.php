                We're a group of rowers starting our own collegiate club to bring a casual, flexible rowing experience to Rochester. The comraderie, challenge, and structure of rowing are important aspects that we would like to continue to foster.
                </br></br>Rowing is an expensive sport to maintain, especially for a group of college students. We're trying to raise money for our startup fees, which include coaching and equipment rental for the spring season. All donations will go directly to supporting these funds.
                </br></br>As an independent program, we'll have the freedom and flexibility to balance our course work with practices, and establish a system that works for students who can't commit to a competitive racing team.
                </br></br>This is an exciting opportunity for all of us and we hope you'll help us support Flower City Collegiate Rowing!

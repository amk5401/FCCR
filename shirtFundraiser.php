                This is your chance to get a message out to the public.
                </br></br>Whether it's your company name, your personal name, a message of luck, or any other message, we will put it on our backs as we row in the Head of the Genessee Regatta.
                </br></br>Rowing can be an expensive sport and as a group of college students, there is only so far we can go while supporting ourselves. As the program grows from 8 to 12 and eventually to more rowers, we will need to rent more and more boats increasing our running costs.
                </br></br>Your support will allow us to continue this growth while also getting your own message out to the world.

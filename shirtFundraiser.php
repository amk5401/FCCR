                This is your chance to support us with an added bonus of advertising!
                </br></br>Whether it's your company name or your personal name, we will put it on our backs as we row in the Head of the Genessee Regatta.
                </br></br>Rowing is an expensive sport and as a group of college students, there is only so far we can go while supporting ourselves. As the program grows
                from 8 to 12+ rowers, we will need to rent more and more boats which increase our running costs.
                </br></br>Your support will allow us to continue this growth into 2017 and hopefully create solidify our recreational collegiate rowing program.
                </br></br>Contact jon@flowercityrowing.org with any questions or comments.
